**Authentication and Permissions System for Laravel 12 API**
============================================================

This repository contains a robust, secure, and scalable backend system for a REST API, built with Laravel 12. The system is designed to be 100% backend, utilizing JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication and a granular role-based access control system managed by a superuser.

**‚ú® Key Features**
-------------------

* **JWT Authentication:** Secure login and registration system that returns a JWT to manage API sessions.
* **Social Login:** Integration with **Google** for third-party authentication, using Laravel Socialite in stateless mode.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
* **Superuser (is\_system\_admin):** A user type with full control over the permissions system.
* **Dynamic Roles & Permissions:** Administrators can dynamically create roles (editor, moderator) and permissions (create-post, delete-user) through the API.
* **Flexible Assignments:** Assign roles to users, permissions to roles, and direct permissions to users.
* **Object-Level Permissions:** Ability to assign permissions on a specific model instance (e.g., "User X can edit the Post with ID 5").
* **RESTful API:** Clear and well-defined endpoints for managing users, authentication, and access control.
* **Security:** Configured with best practices, including route protection middleware, token invalidation (blacklisting), and password hashing.
* **Production-Ready:** A solid, tested system designed to be deployed in a real-world environment.

**üöÄ Tech Stack**
-----------------

* **Framework:** Laravel 12
* **JWT Authentication:** tymon/jwt-auth
* **Social Login:** laravel/socialite
* **Database:** Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.

**‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup**
-----------------------------

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local environment.

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

git clone https://your-repository.com/project.gitcd project

### **2\. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Composer installed.

composer install

### **3\. Configure the Environment**

Copy the example .env.example file to create your own configuration file.

cp .env.example .env

Generate the application key.

php artisan key:generate

Generate the secret for JWTs.

php artisan jwt:secret

### **4\. Configure the .env File**

Open the .env file and configure the following variables:

* **Database:**DB\_CONNECTION=mysqlDB\_HOST=127.0.0.1DB\_PORT=3306DB\_DATABASE=your\_database\_nameDB\_USERNAME=your\_userDB\_PASSWORD=your\_password
* **Application URL:**APP\_URL=http://localhost:8000
* **Google Socialite (Optional):**GOOGLE\_CLIENT\_ID=your-google-client-idGOOGLE\_CLIENT\_SECRET=your-google-client-secretGOOGLE\_REDIRECT\_URI=${APP\_URL}/api/auth/google/callback

### **5\. Run Migrations**

This command will create all the necessary tables in your database.

php artisan migrate

### **6\. Create the First Admin User**

1. Run the application: php artisan serve.
2. Use an API client (like Postman) to register a new user at the POST /api/auth/register endpoint.
3. Access your database and, in the users table, change the value of the is\_system\_admin column to 1 (or true) for the user you just created.

Your environment is now ready!

**API Endpoints**
-----------------

The base URL for all endpoints is {{baseUrl}}/api. All protected routes require a Bearer Token in the Authorization header.

### **Authentication (/auth)**

* POST /register: Registers a new user.
* POST /login: Logs in a user and returns a JWT.
* GET /google/redirect: Gets the redirect URL for Google authentication.
* GET /google/callback: Google's callback to finalize the authentication.
* POST /logout (Protected): Invalidates the current token.
* POST /refresh (Protected): Refreshes an expired token.
* GET /me (Protected): Returns the authenticated user's data.

### **Admin Actions (/admin/access-control)**

_(Requires authentication and for the user to be an is\_system\_admin)_

* POST /roles: Creates a new role.
* POST /permissions: Creates a new permission.
* POST /assign/permission-to-role: Assigns a permission to a role.
* POST /assign/role-to-user: Assigns a role to a user.
* POST /assign/direct-permission-to-user: Assigns a direct permission to a user.
* POST /assign/object-permission: Assigns a permission on a specific object to a user.
* POST /revoke/all-user-access: Revokes all roles and permissions from a user.
* GET /roles: Lists all roles.
* GET /permissions: Lists all permissions.
* GET /users/{user\_uuid}/access: Shows all permissions (direct, role-based, and object-level) for a specific user.

### **Regular User Actions (/me/access)**

_(Requires authentication)_

* GET /: Shows the authenticated user's roles and permissions.
* POST /check-object-permission: Checks if the user has a specific permission for a specific object.

**‚úÖ Testing**
--------------

The project includes a suite of unit and feature tests to ensure quality and correct functionality.

To run all tests, use the following command:

php artisan test

**üì¶ Postman Collection**
-------------------------

A Postman collection has been prepared to facilitate API testing.

1. **Import:** Import the postman\_collection.json file into your Postman client.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:** In Postman, set up the following variables for the collection:

* baseUrl: Your API's URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
* jwt\_token\_admin: Automatically populated upon logging in as an admin.
* jwt\_token\_user: Automatically populated upon logging in as a regular user.
* adminUserId: The UUID of your admin user.
* regularUserId: The UUID of a regular user.
* Other variables like roleName, permissionName, objectId.

1. **Workflow:**

* Register and configure an admin user.
* Register a regular user.
* Log in with both to obtain their tokens.
* Start testing the endpoints!
